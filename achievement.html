		<p>This was a low gross award that I was awarded on 2017. I shot most birdies in that tournament and got it. I felt good on that day because every shot I executed was perfect and accurate. Especially my family was back there with full support.</p>

		<p>This award was a biggest achievement I got so far was on 2019. It was a big tournament for our Myanmar community in which about 30 players competing. And thankfully I won second prize. I felt bad that I couldn't make first place. I was just one shot behind. If I made few more putts back on the round, I would have achieved the first place.</p>
